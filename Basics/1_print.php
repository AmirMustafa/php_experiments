<?php
echo 'Hello World! <br />';                        // for printing in php we use echo statement. <br/> is for line															break must be written within quotes.
print('Hello once again using print<br />');

$a=5;			// $ before alphabet letter indicates variables   --> Syntax for creating variable.
echo "The value is$a";			// NOTE: The difference between '' and "" in echo statement is that if the										variable is assigned with some values eg. say $a = 5, so "" will print the value									i.e. 5 but '' will print the name of the variable i.e. a 
echo 'The value is.$a';

						//NOTE :for concatination in php we use . (dot) operator
